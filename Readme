METHOD TO RUN THE PACKAGE
### Step 1: 
Extract the folder 'Fire_fighting_bot-main' and copy the folder 'fire_fight_1', which is inside src, to your catkin_ws/src
### Step 2: Build the Package. 
 In your terminal go to your catkin_ws folder and type 
 #### catkin_make clean && catkin_make
 Note: Source your catkin workspace (e.g. if catkin_ws is in your home directory, do source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash)
 optional: add this command to your .bashrc
### Step 3: Launch the package
 After sourcing the ~/.bashrc, type 
 #### roslaunch fire_fight_1 template_launch.launch
 This will spawn the robot in Gazebo.
### Step 4: Running the teleop
 Open a new terminal and type 
   #### source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
   #### source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
   #### rosrun fire_fight_1 teleop.py
  If the above command does not work, it is mostly because teleop.py is not an executable.
  Alternative: To make teleop.py an executable. Go to catkin_ws/src/fire_fight_1/src , and type 
   #### chmod +x teleop.py
   Repeat from Step 2.

Now, the teleop is running and you can press the mentioned keys to control the robot.
